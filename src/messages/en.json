    "questions": {
      "howDoesItWork": {
        "question": "How does Pinacle work?",
        "answer": "Pinacle provides instant development environments that run in your browser. Simply connect your GitHub repository, choose your stack, and start coding within seconds.\n\nEach environment includes your choice of tools like VS Code, Claude Code or Cursor CLI, a terminal, and more, all pre-configured and ready to use."
      },
      "whatIsIncluded": {
        "question": "What is included in a pod?",
        "answer": "Each pod includes a full Linux environment with root access, your choice of coding tools (VS Code, Claude Code, Cursor CLI), web terminal, project management with Vibe Kanban, git integration, and support for any programming language or framework. All tools run in your browser with no local installation needed."
      },
      "isDataProtected": {
        "question": "Is my data protected?",
        "answer": "Yes. Your code and data remain private and secure. Each pod runs in a completely isolated and sandboxed container.\n\nWe use industry-standard encryption for data in transit and at rest. Your GitHub credentials are securely stored and never shared."
      },
      "isItForMe": {
        "question": "Is it for me?",
        "answer": "If you're using tools like Lovable, v0, or Bolt but stuck in a prototype, Pinacle is for you. Pinacle gives you real development tools without the setup hassle and easy for you to use.\n\nAlready a developer? Pinacle helps you work on multiple projects simultaneously without cluttering your local machine. When you need to jump back into a project from two weeks ago, it's still there, running and ready, exactly how you left it."
      },
      "privateRepos": {
        "question": "Can I use this with my private GitHub repositories?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Pinacle integrates seamlessly with GitHub. You can clone existing repositories or create new ones directly from the setup flow. We use GitHub Apps for secure authentication and support both personal and organization repositories."
      },
      "billing": {
        "question": "How does billing work?",
        "answer": "Pinacle charges based on usage time and resource tier. You only pay for the time your pods are running. You can start, stop, and delete pods at any time.\n\nWe offer different tiers (small, medium, large, xlarge) to match your project needs. See our pricing page for detailed rates."
      },
      "installDependencies": {
        "question": "Can I install any dependencies?",
        "answer": "Yes! You have full root access in your pod. Install any packages, dependencies, or tools you need using apk, pnpm, uv, or any other package manager. Your install commands can be saved in your pinacle.yaml for automatic setup on new pods."
      },
      "stopPod": {
        "question": "What happens to my work when I stop a pod?",
        "answer": "We create automatic snapshots of your pod's state once you stop it, so you can restore it later. Snapshots incur a small storage cost, but you can delete them at any time.\n\nShould you delete the pod and snapshot, committed changes remain of course safely stored on GitHub, along with a pinacle.yaml file that allows you to recreate your pod's environment later."
      },
      "multipleServices": {
        "question": "Can I run multiple services?",
        "answer": "Yes! Pinacle supports running multiple services and processes simultaneously. Start your frontend, backend, database, and any other services you need. Each gets its own port, and you can access them all through our built-in proxy."
      },
      "configuration": {
        "question": "Do I need to configure anything?",
        "answer": "Not for most projects! Pinacle automatically configures everything for you.\n\nFor advanced customization, you can use pinacle.yaml to define services, processes, environment variables, and startup commands."
