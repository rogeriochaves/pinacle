# üß™ START HERE - Stripe Billing Testing

## Quick Start - Test in 5 Minutes

### 1. Start Your Environment

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2 - Start worker (for usage tracking & grace period)
pnpm tsx src/worker.ts

# Terminal 3 - Forward Stripe webhooks
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### 2. Run Automated Webhook Tests

```bash
# Test all webhook events automatically
./scripts/test-stripe-webhooks.sh
```

This will trigger all 9 webhook events and you should see them being processed in your server logs.

### 3. Check Results

**In your database:**
```sql
-- All events should be logged
SELECT event_type, processed, created_at
FROM stripe_events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for any errors
SELECT * FROM stripe_events
WHERE processing_error IS NOT NULL;
```

**In your server logs:**
- Look for `[Webhook]` messages
- Should see "‚úì Event processed successfully"
- No errors

## Priority Tests (Do These First)

### Test 1: Payment Success Flow ‚≠êÔ∏è
```bash
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
```
**Expected:** Invoice marked paid, grace period cleared, email sent

### Test 2: Payment Failed Flow ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
```bash
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
```
**Expected:**
- Grace period starts (7 days)
- Payment failed email sent
- Customer status = "past_due"

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, status, grace_period_started_at
FROM stripe_customers
WHERE grace_period_started_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### Test 3: Subscription Cancelled ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
```bash
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
```
**Expected:**
- All user pods suspended
- Cancellation email sent
- Customer status = "canceled"

### Test 4: Idempotency ‚≠êÔ∏è
```bash
# Send same event twice
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
```
**Expected:** Second event skipped, logs show "already processed"

## Full Test Checklist

### Core Webhook Events
- [ ] `customer.subscription.created`
- [ ] `customer.subscription.updated`
- [ ] `customer.subscription.deleted`
- [ ] `customer.subscription.paused`
- [ ] `customer.subscription.resumed`
- [ ] `invoice.created`
- [ ] `invoice.finalized`
- [ ] `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- [ ] `invoice.payment_failed`

### System Functionality
- [ ] Events logged in `stripe_events` table
- [ ] No duplicate processing (idempotency works)
- [ ] Emails sent for payment events
- [ ] Pods suspended when subscription cancelled
- [ ] Grace period tracking works
- [ ] Worker processes running (usage tracking, grace period enforcement)

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check event processing
SELECT
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN processed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as processed_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN processing_error IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as error_count
FROM stripe_events
GROUP BY event_type;

-- Check customers
SELECT user_id, status, grace_period_started_at, created_at
FROM stripe_customers
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check invoices
SELECT stripe_invoice_id, status, amount_due/100.0 as amount, created_at
FROM invoices
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check usage tracking
SELECT pod_id, tier_id, quantity, reported_to_stripe, created_at
FROM usage_records
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### ‚ùå Webhooks not arriving
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure stripe listen is running
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env.local matches output
```

### ‚ùå Events showing errors in database
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT stripe_event_id, event_type, processing_error
FROM stripe_events
WHERE processing_error IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Common fixes:**
- Missing environment variables
- Database connection issues
- Email service not configured (will warn but not fail)

### ‚ùå Worker not running
```bash
# Start the worker
pnpm tsx src/worker.ts

# Should see:
# üöÄ Background worker started
# üìã Scheduled tasks:
#   - Metrics cleanup: every hour
#   - Pod usage tracking: every hour
#   - Usage retry: every 6 hours
#   - Grace period enforcement: every 6 hours
```

## Next: Manual E2E Test

Once webhooks are working, test the full user flow:

1. **Create account** ‚Üí Should get welcome email
2. **Try to create pod without subscription** ‚Üí Should be blocked/redirected
3. **Go through Stripe checkout** ‚Üí Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. **Complete payment** ‚Üí Subscription webhook fires
5. **Create a pod** ‚Üí Should work now
6. **Wait for usage tracking** ‚Üí Check `usage_records` table
7. **Check Stripe dashboard** ‚Üí Meter events should appear

## Advanced Testing

See **STRIPE_TESTING_GUIDE.md** for:
- Multi-currency testing (USD, EUR, BRL)
- Grace period enforcement testing
- Email template testing
- Usage tracking verification
- Stripe meter event debugging

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View recent Stripe events
stripe events list --limit 10

# Resend a specific event
stripe events resend evt_xxxxx

# View Stripe logs
stripe logs tail

# Check database
psql $DATABASE_URL
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 9 webhook events process without errors
‚úÖ Events logged in `stripe_events` table
‚úÖ Idempotency working (duplicate events skipped)
‚úÖ Emails sent (check logs or Resend dashboard)
‚úÖ Grace period logic working
‚úÖ Worker running and processing scheduled tasks
‚úÖ Usage tracking creating records

## Get Help

If something isn't working:
1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Check `stripe_events` table for `processing_error`
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Ensure database migrations are applied
5. Check that worker is running
