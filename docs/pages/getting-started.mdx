# Getting Started [Create your first pod]

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (for repository access)
- An account for the AI assistant (OpenAI, Claude, Cursor, etc, optional, but recommended)

## Create a Pod

### From a GitHub Repository

1. Navigate to [pinacle.dev/setup?type=repository](https://pinacle.dev/setup?type=repository)
2. Authorize Pinacle to access your repositories
3. Select a repository
4. Pinacle detects project type and suggests a template
5. Choose services and resource tier
6. Add environment variables if needed
7. Click "Create Pod"

### From a Template

1. Navigate to [pinacle.dev](https://pinacle.dev)
2. Choose a template (Vite, Next.js, Python, etc.)
3. Select AI coding assistant
4. Pick resource tier
5. Click "Start Building"

### Blank Pod

1. Navigate to [pinacle.dev/setup?type=new](https://pinacle.dev/setup?type=new)
2. Choose "Custom Setup"
3. Select base image and services manually
4. Configure resources
5. Create pod

## Pod Provisioning

After clicking create, Pinacle:

1. Allocates resources on a server
2. Installs selected services
3. Clones your repository (if provided)
4. Runs app install commands
5. Starts services and processes

Typical provisioning time: 30-90 seconds

## Access Your Pod

Once provisioned, you get a dashboard with tabs for each service, for example:

- **App**: Your running application
- **Cursor CLI**: AI coding assistant terminal
- **VS Code**: Full IDE in browser
- **Terminal**: Shell access
- **Vibe Kanban**: Task board

## First Steps

### Use AI Assistant

Open the coding assistant tab and start coding:

```
Create a new React component for user profiles
```

### Add a new dependency

Open the Terminal tab and run:

```bash
pnpm add <dependency>
```

Or a new server dependency:

```bash
apk add <dependency>
```

### Commmit Changes

Click on top-left commit icon to open VS Code Git pane.

Alternatively, commit changes via terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profiles"
git push
```

## Configuration

### pinacle.yaml

After pod creation, a `pinacle.yaml` file is added to your workspace:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
tier: dev.small
services:
  - claude-code
  - vibe-kanban
  - code-server
```

Commit this file to version control. See [pinacle.yaml reference](/pinacle-yaml) for details.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are configured during pod setup in standard `.env` format. After creation, you can edit them from the pod dashboard:

1. Open the **Env** tab in your pod dashboard
2. Edit the `.env` content directly
3. Click **Save** then **Push to container**
4. Restart your application if needed

If you've created pods before, Pinacle can automatically suggest environment variables from previous pods using the same repository or template.

See [Environment Variables](/environment-variables) for full details.

## Pod Lifecycle

### Stop Pod

Stops all processes but keeps storage:

```
Dashboard → Stop Pod
```

Pod billing pauses when stopped. Storage costs continue (~$0.01/GB/month).

### Restart Pod

Resume from stopped state:

```
Dashboard → Start Pod
```

All files and configuration remain intact.

### Delete Pod

Permanently removes pod and storage:

```
Dashboard → Settings → Delete Pod
```

**Warning**: This cannot be undone. Create a snapshot first if you want to preserve state.
