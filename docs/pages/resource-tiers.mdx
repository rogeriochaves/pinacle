## Pricing

See current pricing at [pinacle.dev/pricing](https://pinacle.dev/pricing).

## Storage

Pod storage (volumes) is included in the tier. No separate storage charges for pod data.

Storage persists when pod is stopped. It's destroyed only when pod is deleted.

Storage includes:
- Application code
- Dependencies (`node_modules`, etc.)
- Database data
- User files
- Service configurations

Snapshots are charged separately per MB. See [Billing](/billing) for details.

## Changing Tiers

To upgrade or downgrade:

1. Stop the pod
2. Edit `pinacle.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   tier: dev.medium
   ```
3. Recreate the pod

**Note**: You will need to commit your changes and reinstall dependencies, as it's currently not possible to move the same storage to a different tier.

## Resource Limits

### CPU

CPU is shared but guaranteed:
- 1 vCPU = 1 full core
- Bursting allowed for short periods
- Throttling occurs under sustained high load

### Memory

Memory is hard-limited:
- Exceeding limit causes OOM (Out of Memory)
- Process may be killed
- Increase tier if hitting memory limits frequently

### Storage

Storage is hard-limited:
- Exceeding limit prevents writes
- No automatic expansion
- Clean up files or upgrade tier

## Monitoring

Resource usage is visible in the pod details panel:

1. Click pod name dropdown (top left in workbench)
2. Click Settings icon (gear) next to your pod
3. Click "Metrics" tab

Command-line alternatives:

```bash
# CPU usage
top

# Memory usage
free -h

# Disk usage
df -h /workspace
```
