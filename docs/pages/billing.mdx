# Billing [Usage-based pricing via Stripe]

## Pricing Model

### Runtime Billing

Billing starts when pod status changes to "running". \
Billing stops when pod status changes to "stopped" or "terminating".

Charged time = Sum of all running hours in billing period

### Snapshot Storage Billing

Snapshots are charged per MB stored, tracked hourly.

Calculation: Total MB across all snapshots × hours stored

Example: 500MB snapshot stored for 720 hours (30 days) = 360,000 MB-hours
