# Environment Variables [API keys and configuration]

## Adding Variables

Environment variables are set during pod creation only.

1. During pod setup, enter variables in "Environment Variables" section
2. Format: `KEY=value`
3. One variable per line

Currently, environment variables cannot be edited after pod creation through the UI after pod creation.

## Variable Scope

Environment variables are available to:
- All services in the pod
- User processes
- Shell sessions

Variables are loaded when:
- Pod starts
- Services start
- Terminal sessions open

## Viewing Variables

In terminal:

```bash
# List all variables
env

# Check specific variable
echo $API_KEY

# View in process
cat /proc/1/environ
```

## Security

**Do not commit secrets to `pinacle.yaml`**. Environment variables are stored securely to be injected into the pod during runtime.

## Overriding Variables

Variables can be overridden at multiple levels:

1. System defaults (lowest priority)
2. Environment set
3. Pod-specific variables
4. Inline in process command (highest priority)

Example:

```bash
# Override for single command
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Variable Expansion

Shell variable expansion works in process commands:

```yaml
processes:
  - name: app
    startCommand: npm start -- --port $PORT
```

## Multiline Variables

## Modifying Variables

To change environment variables after pod creation, you must:

1. Stop the pod
2. Create a snapshot (to preserve data)
3. Delete the pod
4. Create a new pod from the snapshot with updated variables

Or manually edit via terminal and restart services.
