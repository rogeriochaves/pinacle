# Troubleshooting [Common issues and solutions]

## My App/Process Keeps Being Killed

If your application or processes are unexpectedly terminating, the most common cause is exceeding CPU or memory limits.

### Check Resource Usage

1. Click on the pod dropdown (top-left corner of the workbench)
2. Click "Pod Details"
3. Check the CPU and memory usage graphs

### Causes

**High CPU Usage**: If your process consistently uses CPU above your tier's limit, the system may throttle or kill it to protect other workloads.

**Memory Exceeded**: Pods have hard memory limits. When a process exceeds available RAM, the kernel's OOM (Out of Memory) killer terminates it.

### Solutions

- **Optimize your code**: Look for infinite loops, inefficient algorithms, or memory leaks
- **Upgrade your tier**: If your workload legitimately needs more resources, consider upgrading to a higher [resource tier](/resource-tiers)
- **Reduce concurrent processes**: Run fewer background processes or services simultaneously
- **Check for runaway builds**: Large `npm install` or compilation tasks can spike resource usage temporarily

## Network Connections Failing or Timing Out

Pods run inside Firecracker microVMs with virtualized networking. Some network behaviors differ from a standard Linux environment.

### Common Issues

**Outbound connections blocked**: By default, pods can reach the internet, but some protocols or ports may be restricted.

**Services not accessible**: Your app might be running but not reachable from the browser.

### Solutions

- **Bind to 0.0.0.0**: Ensure your server binds to `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. Firecracker's network bridge requires services to listen on all interfaces.

  ```javascript
  // ❌ Won't be accessible from outside the VM
  app.listen(3000, 'localhost')

  // ✅ Accessible through Pinacle's proxy
  app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0')
  ```

- **Use standard ports**: Pinacle automatically exposes common development ports (3000, 5173, 8080, etc.). Check that your app uses a supported port.

- **Check firewall rules**: If you've modified iptables or installed a firewall inside the pod, it may be blocking traffic.

- **DNS resolution**: If DNS lookups fail, try using explicit IP addresses or check that `/etc/resolv.conf` hasn't been corrupted.

## Pod Won't Start or Gets Stuck Provisioning

### Causes

- **Invalid pinacle.yaml**: Syntax errors or invalid configuration
- **Large repository**: Repositories with many large files take longer to clone
- **Service conflicts**: Incompatible service combinations

### Solutions

- **Check pinacle.yaml syntax**: Validate your YAML at [yamllint.com](https://www.yamllint.com/)
- **Use .gitignore**: Exclude `node_modules`, build artifacts, and large binaries from your repository
- **Start minimal**: Create a pod without extra services, then add them one at a time
- **Check status**: If stuck for more than 5 minutes, try stopping and restarting the pod
