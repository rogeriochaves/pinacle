# Pinacle Documentation [Dev boxes for AI coding agents]

## What is Pinacle?

Pinacle runs your dev environment in isolated VMs (pods) that stay online 24/7. Each pod includes:

- AI coding assistants (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Cursor)
- VS Code Server
- Persistent storage
- Root access to install anything

## Core Concepts

- **Templates**: Pre-configured environments for Vite, Next.js, Python, and more
- **Services**: Modular tools that run in your pod
- **Resource Tiers**: Scale CPU, RAM, and storage based on your needs
- **Snapshots**: Save and restore your pod state
- **GitHub Integration**: Clone repositories and deploy SSH keys automatically
- **Usage-based Billing**: Pay only for runtime hours

## Quick Start
