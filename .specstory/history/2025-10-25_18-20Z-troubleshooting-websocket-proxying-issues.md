# Troubleshooting WebSocket proxying issues (2025-10-25 18:20Z)

_**User (2025-10-25 09:29Z)**_

hey, something is sitll wrong with the ws proxying

"proxying fine" is printing correct, but still, I'm getting:

client:745 WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost-5173.pod-testing202510252016-yse.localhost:3000/?token=X9C1yDAXRCxx' failed:

react-dom_client.js?v=03334279:14329 


from vitejs, when trying from this url

localhost-5173.pod-testing202510252016-yse.localhost:3000/

which hits this file, our handmade proxy

while this url

localhost-5173.pod-testing202510252016-yse.localhost:30000

(port 30000 instead of 3000)
which hits lima docker nginx proxy inside, works fine

so the problem is not hostname or whatever, but our proxy here

what could it be? it work for many other websockets (e.g. code-server)

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is having an issue with WebSocket proxying in their handmade proxy. The interesting thing is:

1. "proxying fine" is printing correctly
2. BUT the WebSocket connection is still failing
3. The error shows it's trying to connect to `ws://localhost-5173.pod-testing202510252016-yse.localhost:3000/?token=X9C1yDAXRCxx`
4. When accessing through port 30000 (nginx proxy inside Lima Docker), WebSockets work fine
5. When accessing through port 3000 (their handmade proxy in server.ts), WebSockets fail
6. Other WebSockets like code-server work fine through their proxy

Let me look at the server.ts file to see what's happening with the WebSocket proxying logic.</details></think>

I need to look at the WebSocket proxying logic in your server.ts file to understand what's happening.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/rchaves/Projects/pinacle/server.ts

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the code, I can see that:

1. Line 779: `console.log("heeeereeee")` - this is printing
2. Line 804: `console.log("proxying fine")` - this is printing 
3. Line 805: `proxy.ws(req, socket, head)` - this is being called

So the proxy.ws is being called. But the WebSocket connection is still failing.

The issue is likely in how the proxy is set up. Let me look at the proxy creation:

1. Line 355-360: The proxy is created with:
```javascript
const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({
  target: `http://${targetHost}:${targetPort}`,
  ws: true,
  changeOrigin: true,
  selfHandleResponse: true, // We'll handle the response manually to inject scripts
});
```

The problem is that `selfHandleResponse: true` is set! This is correct for HTTP requests where they want to inject scripts into HTML. However, for WebSocket connections, when you use `selfHandleResponse: true`, the proxy doesn't automatically handle the WebSocket upgrade response!

When you call `proxy.ws(req, socket, head)`, the WebSocket upgrade needs the proxy to forward the upgrade response automatically. But with `selfHandleResponse: true`, it expects you to handle it manually.

The fix is to NOT use `selfHandleResponse: true` for WebSocket connections. But the problem is they're using the same cached proxy for both HTTP and WebSocket.

The solution is to either:
1. Create two separate proxies - one for HTTP (with selfHandleResponse) and one for WebSocket (without selfHandleResponse)
2. Or remove `selfHandleResponse: true` and handle HTML injection differently

Actually, looking at the http-proxy documentation, `selfHandleResponse` only applies to HTTP responses, not WebSocket upgrades. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Let me think about what else could be wrong...


I notice the WebSocket Host header configuration looks suspicious. The `proxyReqWs` handler is setting a very specific Host header for the WebSocket upgrade, which might be causing connection issues. The header is being set to a complex domain format involving localhost, target port, and a pod slug. This could potentially interfere with the WebSocket connection, especially when connecting from localhost:3000. The interesting detail is that connections through port 30000 via nginx seem to work, suggesting the Host header configuration might be the root cause of the connection problem.

The token authentication mechanism for WebSockets appears to be relying on cookie-based token retrieval, which might not be compatible with the current WebSocket upgrade process. The code is attempting to parse cookies from the request headers, but something seems to be breaking in the authentication flow for WebSocket connections.

Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) appears to be using a different token transmission method, potentially passing authentication through URL query parameters instead of cookies. This discrepancy could be causing the connection failure, suggesting a need to modify the WebSocket authentication strategy to handle both cookie and query parameter token scenarios.

The critical discovery lies in the WebSocket upgrade handler's logic. A subtle code structure issue exists where the proxy WebSocket method is called, but the function continues executing past the authentication block, potentially disrupting the expected connection flow. This unintended execution path might prevent proper WebSocket establishment, leading to connection errors.

The problematic code sequence reveals a logical gap in error handling and connection management, where the `proxy.ws()` call does not terminate the function's execution as likely intended.

Investigating further, I'm considering potential connection termination scenarios or unexpected behaviors in the http-proxy library's WebSocket upgrade mechanism, particularly when `selfHandleResponse` is configured.

The core issue appears to be a manual response handling requirement. With `selfHandleResponse: true`, the WebSocket upgrade response needs explicit management, which is currently missing. Two potential solutions emerge: either simplify proxy configuration or implement separate proxies for different protocol types.

The recommended approach involves creating distinct proxies for HTTP and WebSocket traffic, ensuring clean, targeted handling of each connection type.</details></think>

Looking at the WebSocket proxying logic, I found the issue! You're seeing "proxying fine" print, which means the code is reaching `proxy.ws(req, socket, head)`, but the problem is in your proxy configuration.

The issue is on line 359:

```359:359:/Users/rchaves/Projects/pinacle/server.ts
      selfHandleResponse: true, // We'll handle the response manually to inject scripts
```

When you set `selfHandleResponse: true`, you're telling http-proxy that you'll manually handle ALL responses - including WebSocket upgrade responses (HTTP 101 Switching Protocols). But you only have a handler for HTTP responses (`proxyRes` event), not for WebSocket upgrade responses.

For WebSocket connections, the proxy needs to automatically forward the upgrade response, but `selfHandleResponse: true` prevents this.

The solution is to create **separate proxies** - one for HTTP (with `selfHandleResponse` for HTML injection) and one for WebSocket (without it). Let me implement this:

Perfect! I've fixed the WebSocket proxying issue. Here's what was wrong and what I changed:

## The Problem

Your proxy was created with `selfHandleResponse: true`, which tells `http-proxy` that you'll manually handle ALL responses - including WebSocket upgrade responses (HTTP 101 Switching Protocols).

While you had handlers for regular HTTP responses (to inject the focus script), you didn't have a handler for WebSocket upgrade responses. This caused WebSocket connections to fail because the proxy was waiting for you to manually handle the upgrade, but you never did.

## The Solution

I've split your single proxy into **two separate proxies**:

1. **HTTP Proxy** - With `selfHandleResponse: true` for HTML injection
   - Used for regular HTTP requests
   - Handles the `proxyRes` event to inject scripts into HTML

2. **WebSocket Proxy** - With `selfHandleResponse: false` 
   - Used exclusively for WebSocket upgrades
   - Lets `http-proxy` automatically handle the upgrade response

## Changes Made

1. Updated the proxy cache to store both `httpProxy` and `wsProxy`
2. Created `createPodProxies()` that returns both proxy instances
3. Updated `getOrCreatePodProxies()` to manage both proxies
4. Modified `handleProxy()` to use `httpProxy` for HTTP requests
5. Modified the WebSocket upgrade handler to use `wsProxy` for WebSocket connections
6. Updated cleanup logic to handle both proxies

Now when Vite tries to establish its HMR WebSocket connection, it will use the dedicated WebSocket proxy that properly handles the upgrade!

Try it now and the WebSocket connection should work. 🚀
