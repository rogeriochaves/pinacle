disable the minimap by default as well

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to disable the minimap by default. Looking at the attached selection, I can see they're working with VS Code settings in the `service-registry.ts` file. The selection shows:

```
{
  "files.autoSave": "off",
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark Modern",
  "security.workspace.trust.enabled": false
}
```

This appears to be a VS Code settings configuration object. To disable the minimap, I need to add the setting `"editor.minimap.enabled": false` to this configuration.

Let me read the file first to see the full context and then make the appropriate change.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added the `"editor.minimap.enabled": false` setting to the VS Code configuration. This will disable the minimap by default when code-server is set up for new pods.
