# Render logs on the same line (2025-10-26 20:26Z)

_**User (2025-10-26 18:00Z)**_

hey there, so on the provisioning terminal view, sometimes we have some logs that "write to the same line", while we just render it all with pre. Is it possible to detect and render them on the same line? I think its \r or something, idk but you probably know better

The user is asking about handling terminal logs that overwrite the same line using carriage return (`\r`) characters. They're right - `\r` is the carriage return character that moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line without a newline, which allows overwriting the same line (commonly used for progress bars, spinners, etc.).

Currently, they're rendering logs with a `<pre>` tag, which just displays everything as-is, so lines with `\r` aren't being handled properly.

Let me first look at the provisioning page to see how logs are currently being rendered.</details></think>

I'll help you handle carriage return (`\r`) characters in the terminal logs so that lines that overwrite themselves render correctly. Let me first check how the logs are currently being rendered.

I can see the issue. The logs are being rendered with `whitespace-pre-wrap` which just displays the content as-is. When terminal output uses `\r` (carriage return) to overwrite lines (like progress bars do), this doesn't work properly.

I need to create a utility function that processes terminal output to handle carriage returns properly. The logic should:
1. Split the text by newlines
2. For each line, if it contains `\r`, split by `\r` and keep only the last part (since `\r` returns the cursor to the start of the line, effectively overwriting previous content)
3. Return the processed text

Let me create a utility function and then update the rendering code to use it.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! Terminal output uses `\r` (carriage return) to overwrite the same line, which is commonly used for progress bars, spinners, and updating status messages. Let me create a utility function to process these logs correctly.

These are existing warnings not related to my changes (they're about unused variables that were already in the code). The function I added doesn't introduce any new linting issues. Let me verify the changes work correctly by reviewing what I did:

1. Created a `processTerminalOutput` function that:
   - Splits text by newlines to process each line
   - For lines containing `\r`, splits by `\r` and keeps only the last segment (which is what would be visible after the carriage return overwrites previous content)
   - Joins the processed lines back with newlines

2. Applied this function to both `log.stdout` and `log.stderr` when rendering

This should handle cases like:
- Progress bars: "Downloading... 10%\rDownloading... 50%\rDownloading... 100%" → will show "Downloading... 100%"
- Spinners and loading indicators
- Any other terminal output that uses `\r` to update the same line

The solution is complete and should work correctly!</details></think>

---

Great! The linter warnings are pre-existing and unrelated to the changes I made. 

## Summary

I've successfully added carriage return (`\r`) handling to your provisioning terminal view! Here's what I did:

1. **Created a `processTerminalOutput` function** that:
   - Splits the text by newlines to process each line individually
   - For any line containing `\r`, it splits by that character and keeps only the **last segment** (since `\r` moves the cursor back to the start of the line, effectively overwriting everything before it)
   - Returns the cleaned text

2. **Applied it to both stdout and stderr** when rendering the logs

This will now correctly handle common terminal patterns like:
- **Progress bars**: `"Downloading... 10%\rDownloading... 50%\rDownloading... 100%"` → Shows: `"Downloading... 100%"`
- **Spinners**: Lines that update with rotating characters
- **Status updates**: Any output that overwrites the same line

The logs will now display cleanly without showing the intermediate overwritten content! 🎉

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is seeing ANSI color codes in the terminal output. These are escape sequences that terminals use to display colors and formatting. For example:
- `[1m` = bold
- `[0m` = reset
- `[0;34m` = blue color
- `[0;32m` = green color
- `[1A` = move cursor up
- `[2K` = clear line

The user wants to strip these out so they just see plain text. I need to modify the `processTerminalOutput` function to also remove ANSI escape codes.

The standard regex for matching ANSI escape codes is: `/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m/g` or more comprehensively `/\x1b\[[^m]*m/g` or even more broadly `/\x1b\[[^\]]*./g` to catch all escape sequences.

Actually, looking at the examples, they use `[` not `\x1b[`. So they might already be partially processed or encoded. Let me handle both cases:
- `\x1b[` (ESC character followed by [)
- Just the escape sequences as shown

Looking more carefully at the examples:
- `[1m` 
- `[0m`
- `[0;34m`
- `[1A`
- `[2K`
- `[0;32m`

These look like they might have the escape character already stripped or they're being displayed literally. The standard ANSI escape code format is `\x1b[...` or `\u001b[...`.

I should handle both:
1. Full ANSI escape codes with ESC character: `\x1b[...`
2. The bracket notation that might appear if ESC is missing: `[...m` patterns

Let me create a regex that strips both ANSI color codes and cursor movement codes.

Common ANSI escape sequences:
- `\x1b[` or `\u001b[` followed by numbers, semicolons, and a letter


I'll develop a comprehensive regex that captures multiple escape sequence variations. The pattern needs to be flexible enough to match different representations of escape codes, including those with or without the explicit escape character.</details></think>

Ah yes, those are ANSI color codes and terminal control sequences! Let me update the function to strip those out as well:

Perfect! I've updated the function to strip ANSI escape codes. The regex `/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z]/g` will match:
- `\x1b[` - the escape character followed by an open bracket
- `[0-9;]*` - zero or more digits and semicolons (for parameters)
- `[a-zA-Z]` - a letter that terminates the sequence (like 'm' for colors, 'K' for clearing, 'A' for cursor up, etc.)

This will strip out things like:
- `[1m` -> `\x1b[1m` (bold)
- `[0m` -> `\x1b[0m` (reset)
- `[0;34m` -> `\x1b[0;34m` (blue)
- `[0;32m` -> `\x1b[0;32m` (green)
- `[1A` -> `\x1b[1A` (cursor up)
- `[2K` -> `\x1b[2K` (clear line)

I added an eslint-disable comment for the no-control-regex rule since we're intentionally matching control characters.

Perfect! The control character error is now gone, and we're only left with the pre-existing warnings about unused variables (router and utils) which were already there before my changes.

Let me summarize what I did for the user.</details></think>

---

Perfect! ✨ The function now strips out all those ANSI color codes and control sequences. 

Your logs will now display cleanly without:
- Color codes: `[1m`, `[0m`, `[0;34m`, `[0;32m`
- Terminal control sequences: `[1A` (cursor up), `[2K` (clear line)
- Carriage returns that overwrite lines

So instead of seeing:
```
[1mCursor Agent Installer[0m
[0;34m▸[0m Detecting system architecture...
```

You'll see the clean version:
```
Cursor Agent Installer
▸ Detecting system architecture...
```

The function processes everything in order: first strips ANSI codes, then handles carriage returns. This way your terminal output will be much more readable! 🎯

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants stderr to only be rendered in red if the command exit code was not successful (non-zero). Currently, stderr is always rendered in red. I need to modify the rendering logic to check the exit code and conditionally apply the red color.

Looking at the code structure, I can see that each log has an `exitCode` field. I should render stderr in red only if `exitCode !== 0` (or if it's null, meaning still running, we might want to keep it red as a warning).

Let me update the stderr rendering section.</details></think>

I'll update the stderr rendering to only show it in red when the exit code indicates failure:

Perfect! ✨ Now stderr will only be rendered in red when the command actually failed (non-zero exit code). If the command succeeded (exit code 0), stderr will be shown in the same color as stdout (slate-300), since sometimes commands write informational messages to stderr even when they succeed.

This makes it much clearer when there's an actual error versus just verbose output!

Done! ✅ 

Committed the stderr color change with the message:
```
feat(provisioning): render stderr in default color for successful commands
```

I won't commit again unless you explicitly ask me to. 👍

wait no, it also shouldn't render red if status code is pending, red only for certainly not successful

The user wants stderr to only be red when the command has definitely failed (non-zero, non-null exit code). If the exit code is null (still running/pending) or 0 (success), it should be in the default color.

Let me update the logic to check if exitCode is not null AND not 0.</details></think>

You're right! Let me fix that - stderr should only be red when we know the command failed (exitCode is not null and not 0):

Good! Now the logic is:
- Red only when exitCode is not null AND not 0 (definitively failed)
- Default slate color when exitCode is null (still running) or 0 (success)

This is correct behavior. Let me check for lint errors.</details></think>

Perfect! Now the logic is correct:
- If exitCode is null (still running/pending): text-slate-300
- If exitCode is 0 (successful): text-slate-300
- If exitCode is not null and not 0 (failed): text-red-400

This makes much more sense!</details></think>

---

Perfect! Now stderr will only be red when the command has definitely failed (exitCode is not null AND not 0). For pending commands (null exitCode) or successful commands (exitCode 0), it will show in the default slate color. Much better! ✅
