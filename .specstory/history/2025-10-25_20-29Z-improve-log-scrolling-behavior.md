# Improve log scrolling behavior (2025-10-25 20:29Z)

_**User (2025-10-25 20:27Z)**_

so, in the provisioning page, it only scrolls to bottom once new logs arrive, however sometimes the last log stdout changes cuz data is still being streamed, I want to scroll bottom also in that situation

The user is describing an issue with the provisioning page where:
1. It currently scrolls to bottom when new logs arrive
2. However, sometimes the last log's stdout changes because data is still being streamed
3. They want to scroll to bottom in that situation too

Let me first read the provisioning page to understand how it currently works.</details></think>

I'll help you fix the scrolling behavior in the provisioning page so it scrolls to bottom when existing log content is updated. Let me first check the current implementation.

I can see the issue. The current code only scrolls to bottom when `allLogs.length` changes (line 141):

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (consoleEndRef.current && allLogs.length > 0) {
    consoleEndRef.current.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" });
  }
}, [allLogs.length]);
```

However, when the last log's stdout is updated (because data is still being streamed), the `allLogs.length` doesn't change - only the content of the last log changes. So we need to also trigger scrolling when the content of `allLogs` changes, not just when the length changes.

The fix is simple: change the dependency from `[allLogs.length]` to `[allLogs]`. This way, whenever any log content changes (including the last log's stdout being updated), it will trigger the scroll.</details></think>

I can see the issue. The scrolling effect on line 136-141 only triggers when `allLogs.length` changes, but when the last log's stdout is being streamed and updated, the length stays the same - only the content changes.

The fix is to change the dependency from `allLogs.length` to `allLogs` so it triggers on any content change:

Good! I've made the change. Now the effect will trigger whenever the `allLogs` array changes, which includes when the last log's stdout is updated with streaming data. This should solve the user's issue.

Let me check for any linter errors.</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated the dependency from `[allLogs.length]` to `[allLogs]`. Now the scroll-to-bottom effect will trigger not only when new logs are added (length changes), but also when existing log content is updated - such as when the last log's stdout is being streamed and continuously updated.

This means the page will scroll to the bottom in both scenarios:
1. When new logs arrive (as before)
2. When the last log's stdout changes because data is still being streamed (new behavior)

The change is minimal and efficient - React will handle the comparison and only trigger the effect when the array actually changes.
