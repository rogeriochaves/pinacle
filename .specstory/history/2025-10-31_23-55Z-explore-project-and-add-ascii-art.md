_**User (2025-10-31 23:52Z)**_

hey explore the project first and what's it about, the landing page and so

The user wants me to:
1. First explore the project to understand what it's about and the landing page
2. Then add ASCII art for "pinacle" (they spelled it with one 'n', but I notice the project is called "pinacle" in the directory name too) in big letters on server start

Let me start by exploring the project structure and understanding what it's about.</details></think>

I'll explore the project to understand what it's about, then add a nice ASCII art banner for server startup.

Great! Now I understand the project. It's **Pinacle** - a platform for secure, lightweight virtual machines pre-configured with Claude Code, Vibe Kanban, and VS Code for AI-powered development. It's essentially a cloud IDE/VM platform with:

- Next.js 15 frontend
- tRPC backend
- PostgreSQL database
- gVisor container orchestration
- Stripe billing
- GitHub integration
- 24/7 development environments

Now let me look at the server.ts file more closely to see where the server starts and where I should add the ASCII art.</details></think>

Now I understand the project! **Pinacle** is a platform that provides secure, lightweight virtual machines pre-configured with AI development tools (Claude Code, Vibe Kanban, VS Code). It's essentially a cloud-based IDE/VM platform with 24/7 uptime, team collaboration, and scalable resources.

Let me read more of the server.ts to find the best place to add the ASCII art:

Perfect! I can see that around lines 855-859 is where the server startup messages are logged. I should add a nice ASCII art banner before these log messages. Let me create a nice ASCII art for "PINACLE" in big letters.

I'll add the ASCII art right after the server starts listening, before the logger.info statements.

Let me create a nice ASCII art. I'll use a big, bold style for "PINACLE".</details></think>

Perfect! Now I'll add a nice ASCII art banner for "PINACLE" when the server starts. Let me add it right at the startup:

Great! I've added a nice ASCII art banner for "PINACLE" in big letters. The banner will display when the server starts. Let me check if there are any linter errors introduced by this change.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added a beautiful ASCII art banner for "PINACLE" that will display when the server starts up. 

The banner features:
- Large block letters spelling "PINACLE" 
- A rocket emoji (🚀) with the tagline "AI-Powered Development VMs"
- Clean spacing before the regular server startup messages

Now when you run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`, you'll see this nice banner greeting you! Let me check for any linting issues:

Good, the linter errors are pre-existing and not related to my changes. My changes don't introduce any new errors. The ASCII art addition is clean and ready to go!</details></think>

Great! The linter errors are pre-existing (not from my changes). The ASCII art banner is all set! 

When you start the server with `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`, you'll now see a beautiful **PINACLE** banner in big ASCII art letters, followed by the tagline "🚀 AI-Powered Development VMs" and then the regular server startup messages.

To summarize what I learned about the project:
- **Pinacle** is a platform for secure, lightweight development VMs
- Pre-configured with AI tools: Claude Code, Vibe Kanban, VS Code  
- Built with Next.js 15, tRPC, PostgreSQL, gVisor containers
- Offers 24/7 uptime, team collaboration, and scalable resources (1GB-16GB RAM)
- Uses Stripe for billing and NextAuth for authentication
- Supports both local development (with Lima VM on macOS) and production deployment
