# Will services start automatically on reboot? (2025-10-11 17:23Z)

_**User (2025-10-11 11:55Z)**_

hey, will those rc-service and systemctl services start automatically once the server is restarted too?

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about whether the services configured in the provision-server.sh script will start automatically when the server is restarted. They're specifically asking about both rc-service and systemctl services.

Let me look at the provision-server.sh file to understand what services are being configured and how they're set up for auto-start.</details></think>

---

I'll check the provision-server.sh script to see how the services are configured for automatic startup.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/rchaves/Projects/pinacle/scripts/provision-server.sh

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the script, I can see:

1. **For Lima (Alpine Linux) with OpenRC** (lines 264-292):
   - Line 286: `sudo rc-update add pinacle-agent default` - This adds the service to the default runlevel, making it start on boot
   - The service uses OpenRC init script at `/etc/init.d/pinacle-agent`

2. **For SSH/remote servers with systemd** (lines 293-316):
   - Line 313: `systemctl enable pinacle-agent` - This enables the service to start on boot
   - The service includes `[Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target` which tells systemd to start it in multi-user mode

3. **For local** (lines 317-322):
   - Just uses nohup to run in background - this WON'T start automatically on restart

So to answer the user's question:
- Yes for rc-service (OpenRC) - the `rc-update add pinacle-agent default` command ensures it starts on boot
- Yes for systemctl (systemd) - the `systemctl enable` command ensures it starts on boot
- No for local installations - it just uses nohup which won't persist across reboots</details></think>

---

Looking at the provision script, I can answer your question:

**Yes, both services will start automatically on server restart:**

1. **For Lima/Alpine (OpenRC/rc-service)** - Line 286:
   ```bash
   sudo rc-update add pinacle-agent default
   ```
   This adds the service to the `default` runlevel, which means it will start automatically when the server boots.

2. **For SSH/remote servers (systemd)** - Line 313:
   ```bash
   systemctl enable pinacle-agent
   ```
   This enables the service to start on boot. Additionally, the service file includes:
   ```ini
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   Which tells systemd to start the service when the system reaches multi-user mode.

**However**, there's one exception: the **local** installation (lines 319-321) just uses `nohup` to run in the background, which **won't** survive a reboot. If you need persistence for local installations, you'd want to set up a proper systemd service or launchd (on macOS) instead.

_**User (2025-10-11 11:55Z)**_

nvm the local installation, but for my lima machine (maybe it behaves dirrently) the service didnt' start automatically after book

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that on their Lima machine, the OpenRC service didn't start automatically after boot. Let me check the OpenRC script again. 

Looking at lines 286:
```bash
limactl shell "$LIMA_VM" -- sudo rc-update add pinacle-agent default || true
```

The service is being added to the `default` runlevel. However, there could be a few issues:

1. The service might not be configured correctly
2. There might be an issue with dependencies
3. The OpenRC script might need adjustment

Let me think about what could be wrong. Looking at the OpenRC script (lines 265-282), I see:

```bash
depend() {
    need net
    after docker
}
```

This says it needs network and should start after docker. But if docker isn't starting or isn't in the default runlevel, this could prevent the service from starting.

Also, OpenRC in Alpine might need the service to be in a specific state or might have issues with the way it's set up.

Let me suggest some debugging steps and potentially fix the issue.</details></think>

Let me help you debug why the OpenRC service isn't starting automatically on Lima after boot. There could be a few issues with the current setup.

```bash
limactl shell gvisor-alpine -- sudo rc-update show default

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, the service is registered. Let me check its status and see if there are any errors in the logs.</details></think>

```bash
limactl shell gvisor-alpine -- sudo rc-service pinacle-agent status
```

```
 * status: stopped

```

```
cat: can't open '/var/log/pinacle-agent.err': No such file or directory
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me try to start the service manually to see what error we get.</details></think>

 * Starting Pinacle Server Agent ...

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah! There's the issue! The error message says: `chdir '/opt/pinacle/server-agent': No such file or directory`

The service is configured but the directory doesn't exist. Let me check if the directory actually exists.</details></think>

---

Ah, I found the issue! The error message shows: **`chdir '/opt/pinacle/server-agent': No such file or directory`**

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
limactl shell gvisor-alpine -- ls -la /opt/pinacle/server-agent/
```

```
ls: /opt/pinacle/server-agent/: No such file or directory
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The directory doesn't exist! The provisioning script probably didn't complete successfully, or the agent was never properly installed on this Lima VM. 

The user likely needs to re-run the provision script, but there might also be an issue with the OpenRC service configuration that's preventing it from working properly even when the directory exists.

Actually, looking back at the OpenRC script, I notice a potential issue. The script uses:
- `command_background=true` 
- `directory="/opt/pinacle/server-agent"`

The issue is that when OpenRC tries to start the service, if the `directory` doesn't exist, it will fail silently. But there might be another issue too - the way the service is configured might not be ideal for auto-starting.

Let me suggest fixing the provision script to make the service more robust.</details></think>

---

The directory doesn't exist! The agent was never properly installed. However, there's also a potential issue with the OpenRC service configuration that could cause problems even after reinstalling.

Let me check the current OpenRC script and then fix it:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
limactl shell gvisor-alpine -- cat /etc/init.d/pinacle-agent
```

```

depend() {
    need net

}
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The OpenRC script looks okay, but I think there might be a better configuration. Let me update the provision-server.sh script to:

1. Add better error handling for the OpenRC service
2. Add a `start()` function that can check if the directory exists before trying to start
3. Make sure the service is more robust

Actually, looking at the OpenRC documentation, the issue might be that `command_background=true` with node processes can sometimes be tricky. We might want to use `start-stop-daemon` more explicitly or ensure proper signal handling.

Let me update the script to make it more robust.</details></think>

---

I see the issue. The OpenRC script needs to be more robust. Let me update the provision script to include better error handling and ensure the service starts properly on boot:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! Now the OpenRC script is more robust with:
1. Added `localmount` to the `depend()` section to ensure the filesystem is fully mounted
2. Added a `start_pre()` function that checks if the directory exists, if node exists, and if the agent script exists before trying to start
3. Creates log files if they don't exist

Now the user needs to re-run the provision script to install the agent properly. Let me tell them what to do.</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated the provision script with a more robust OpenRC service configuration. The changes include:

1. **Added `localmount` dependency** - ensures the filesystem is fully mounted before starting

_**User (2025-10-11 11:55Z)**_

you made it worse, now it will pretend to run, anyway, nevermind that, we indeed need to improve robustness but elsewhere:

because my main server failed, the agent crashed and die

it should never do that! if it crashes it should try to restart, infinitely!

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is right - the server agent crashes when it can't register with the main server, and it should be more resilient. The service should:

1. Retry on failures instead of crashing
2. Have the OpenRC/systemd service configured to automatically restart on failure

Let me look at the server-agent code to see what needs to be fixed, and then update both the agent code and the provision script to handle restarts properly.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! The agent should be resilient and retry on failures instead of crashing. Let me fix this in two places:

1. **The agent code** - make it retry on failures
2. **The OpenRC service** - configure automatic restart

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/rchaves/Projects/pinacle/server-agent/src/index.ts

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issues:

1. Lines 46-48: If registration fails, it throws an error which causes the process to exit (line 297)
2. Line 126-128: The registerServer method throws the error instead of handling it gracefully
3. The agent should retry registration instead of dying

Let me fix the agent to:
1. Not exit on registration failure
2. Retry registration on the next heartbeat interval
3. Continue running even if initial registration fails

I should also update the provision script to configure the OpenRC service with automatic restart, though the user reverted my changes. Let me focus on making the agent itself more resilient first.</details></think>

_**User (2025-10-11 11:55Z)**_

NO MAN, not what I mean

nodejs can crash for WHATEVER REASON

can't systemctl/rc-service make sure to restart it forever?
would nohup be the most robust thing here? I want the most robut thingie

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Ah! The user wants the SERVICE MANAGER (systemctl/rc-service) to handle the restarts, not the Node.js code itself. They want the service configuration to automatically restart the process if it crashes for ANY reason.

For systemd (remote servers), we can add `Restart=always` and related directives.
For OpenRC (Lima/Alpine), we can use `respawn=true` and related directives.

The user wants maximum robustness at the service level, not application level.

Let me fix the provision script to configure automatic restarts in both systemd and OpenRC.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! Now let me verify this is correct. The changes I made:

**For OpenRC (Lima/Alpine):**
- `respawn_delay=5` - wait 5 seconds before restarting
- `respawn_max=0` - unlimited restart attempts (0 = infinite)
- `respawn_period=60` - the period in which respawn_max applies

**For systemd (SSH/remote):**
- `Restart=always` - restart on any exit condition
- `RestartSec=5` - wait 5 seconds before restarting
- `StartLimitIntervalSec=0` - disable the start limit (allows infinite restarts)
- `StandardOutput=journal` and `StandardError=journal` - better logging

This should make both services restart infinitely and robustly!</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've updated the provision script with robust auto-restart configuration for both service managers:

**For OpenRC (Lima/Alpine):**
- `respawn_delay=5` - wait 5 seconds before restarting
- `respawn_max=0` - **unlimited restart attempts** (0 = infinite)
- `respawn_period=60` - time window for respawn attempts

**For systemd (SSH/remote):**
- `Restart=always` - restart on any exit condition (success, failure, crash, etc.)
- `RestartSec=5` - wait 5 seconds before restarting
- `StartLimitIntervalSec=0` - **disable start limit** (allows infinite restarts)
- Better logging to journald

Now the agent will **restart forever** if it crashes for any reason - network issues, API failures, segfaults, out of memory, anything. The service manager will keep bringing it back up every 5 seconds, infinitely.

You'll need to re-run the provision script to update the service configuration on your Lima VM. Want me to help you do that?
