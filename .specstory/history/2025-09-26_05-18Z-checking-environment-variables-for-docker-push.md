# Checking environment variables for Docker push (2025-09-26 05:18Z)

_**User (2025-09-27 13:35Z)**_

I have DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN on my .env, coupled with this npx dotenv, will it be enough so the push works? How can I be explicit about those envs?

also, make the script fail if .env file is not found

I'll help you check the Docker build script and make it more robust with explicit environment variable handling and .env file validation.

---

Could not find file /Users/rchaves/Projects/pinacle/.env in the workspace.

I can see that you don't have a `.env` file in the root directory, but I notice there's an `env.example` in the worktrees directory. Let me check if there's a `.env` file that might be ignored by git:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
ls -la /Users/rchaves/Projects/pinacle/ | grep -E "\.env"
```

```
-rw-r--r--@  1 rchaves  staff    2307 Sep 26 07:26 .env
-rw-r--r--@  1 rchaves  staff     679 Sep 26 07:25 .env.example
-rw-r--r--@  1 rchaves  staff    2166 Sep 26 07:26 .env.local
```

Great! You do have a `.env` file. Let me check its contents to see if it has the required Docker Hub credentials:

Great! I can see you do have a `.env` file (the terminal command showed it exists). Now let me improve your Docker build script to be more robust and explicit about environment variables.

Based on your current setup, using `npx dotenv -c --` should work with your `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` variables, but let's make the script more explicit and robust:

Perfect! I've significantly improved your Docker build script. Here's what I changed:

## Key Improvements:

1. **‚úÖ .env File Validation**: The script now checks if the `.env` file exists and fails gracefully with a clear error message if it doesn't.

2. **‚úÖ Explicit Environment Variable Handling**: 
   - Loads variables directly from `.env` using `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)`
   - Validates that both `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` are present
   - Fails with clear error messages if either is missing

3. **‚úÖ Proper Docker Hub Authentication**: 
   - Uses `docker login` with your credentials explicitly
   - Uses `--password-stdin` for secure token handling

4. **‚úÖ Correct Image Tagging**: 
   - Tags the image with your Docker Hub username prefix (`$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/code-server-alpine`)
   - This is required for pushing to Docker Hub

5. **‚úÖ Better Error Handling**: 
   - `set -e` makes the script exit on any error
   - Clear progress messages with emojis for better UX

## Regarding Your Original Approach:

Your original approach with `npx dotenv -c --` would have worked for loading the environment variables, but there were a few issues:
- No validation that the `.env` file exists
- No explicit Docker login step
- The image wasn't tagged with your username, so the push would fail
- No validation that the required environment variables are present

## To Use the Script:

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=your_username
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN=your_token
```

Then run the script from the project root:
```bash
./docker/build-and-push-code-server-alpine.sh
```

The script will now be much more robust and provide clear feedback about what's happening at each step!

sorry but I don't want it to mess my global docker login, is it possible? use only for this "session"?

---

_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet)**_

Absolutely! You're right to be concerned about that. The `docker login` command does affect your global Docker configuration. Let me modify the script to use a temporary Docker config directory that won't interfere with your global Docker login.

Perfect! Now the script uses a **temporary Docker configuration** that won't affect your global Docker login. Here's what changed:

## Key Improvements:

1. **üîí Isolated Docker Config**: 
   - Creates a temporary directory using `mktemp -d`
   - Sets `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable to point to this temp directory
   - All Docker commands will use this isolated config instead of your global `~/.docker/config.json`

2. **üßπ Automatic Cleanup**:
   - Uses a `trap cleanup EXIT` to ensure the temporary directory is always cleaned up
   - This runs even if the script fails or is interrupted (Ctrl+C)

3. **üõ°Ô∏è No Global Impact**:
   - Your existing Docker login credentials remain untouched
   - After the script finishes, your Docker CLI will work exactly as before
   - The temporary login is completely isolated to this script execution

## How It Works:

1. Script creates a temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp/tmp.abc123`)
2. Sets `DOCKER_CONFIG=/tmp/tmp.abc123` 
3. Docker login stores credentials in the temp directory instead of `~/.docker/`
4. Push operation uses the temporary credentials
5. Script exits and automatically deletes the temp directory

Your global Docker configuration remains completely unchanged! This is a much safer approach for CI/CD scripts and automation.
