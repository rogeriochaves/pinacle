<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a cross-origin error when trying to access the `contentWindow.document` of an iframe. This is a classic CORS/cross-origin policy issue.

Looking at the code snippet:
```javascript
(iframe as HTMLIFrameElement).contentWindow?.document.body.focus();
```

This is trying to access the `document` property of an iframe's `contentWindow`, but if the iframe is loading content from a different origin (different domain, protocol, or port), the browser's same-origin policy will block this access.

Let me read the full workbench.tsx file to understand the context better.</details></think>

I can see you're encountering a cross-origin security error when trying to access the iframe's document. This happens when the iframe loads
