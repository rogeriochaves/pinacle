<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user just said "hi". This is a greeting and likely the start of a conversation. I should respond in a friendly, professional manner and let them know I'm ready to help with their coding project.

Based on the context, I can see they have a project called "pinacle" that appears to be a complex application with:
- Next.js frontend (TypeScript/React)
- Docker configurations
- Database with Drizzle ORM
- Server agent components
- Various components including a workbench component that's currently open

I should greet them back and let them know I'm ready to help with whatever they need in their project.</details></think>

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm here to help you with your Pinacle project. I can see you have the `workbench.tsx` component open. 

What would you like to work on today?
